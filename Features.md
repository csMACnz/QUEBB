Feature Requests
================
This is where i will put quick features that need expanded on

Multiple Uris (Aliases)
-----------------------
There needs to be the ability to, once a slug had been created and cannot be changed, give alias slugs 
that also lead to the same page.  This implies that once a slug is set (primary) it cannot be changed, 
except to add more slugs.

Disqus
------
Use [Disqus](https://disqus.com/websites/) for comments on the blog.  Need to check if this is a user choice, if there should be a plugin model for comment provider at the consumer level? can you swap out disqus for a bespoke/integrated solution

Share
-----
Build in share providers, and the ability to share to social networking, by email etc. Extensible? shoudl this even be part of the engine itself? formatters of posts for each share provider? Validations per provider?

Use Cases
=========
This is established use cases that can be built out and tested
