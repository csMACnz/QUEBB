Architecture
============

I have based my architecture on two talks:

8 Lines of Code - Greg Young
----------------------------

This talk has a technique to not hide the magic, while still performing dependency
 inversion, and aspect oriented design, such as logging, security, tracing etc.

 - Uncle Bob

In The Clean Architecture i have taken the concepts of the Entities, Boundaries and 
building out use cases rather than layers, as well as the decoupling of persistance and UI
using Interface Adapaters to abstract out all the Frameworks.
